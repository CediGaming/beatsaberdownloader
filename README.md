# BeatSaber-Downloader for Python

This project is designed to easily download BeatSaber-Maps from [beatsaver.com](https://beatsaver.com) and [bsaber.com](https://bsaber.com). (It might also work with others, but only these ones are confirmed.)

More features (possibly) coming soonâ„¢.

If there are any other providers you would like me to integrate, please let me know!
Same goes for finding bugs!
